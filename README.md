# Simpletron

Simpletron is a software based computer simulator which is capable of executing instructions written in Simpletron Machine Language (SML)

To initialize this code, use a command like this:
```
gcc main.c -o main
```
Then, execute the code i.e. compile SHL code like this:
```
./main $filename $outputfilename
```

Finally, for executing the SHL generated code, do this in Execution directory :
```
gcc main.c -o main
./main ../$outputfilename
```

##  About
- Simpletron contains an accumulator â€“ a special register in which information is put before it uses in calculations and or examined in various ways
-	It has memory of size 100 words (can be extended) each word can be referenced by their location 00, 01, 02, ...., 99
-	Word is a signed four digit decimal number such as +3364, -1293, +0007, -0001
- SML instructions occupies one word of Simpletron's Memory<br/>
    > SML instructions will always be positive.<br/>
    > SML data can be positive or negative.<br/>
    > The first two digits of the SML instruction are the operation code.<br/>
    > The last two digits of the SML instruction are the operand (i.e memory location of the operand)<br/>
- Opcodes used:&nbsp;
    > READ      : 10<br/>
    > WRITE     : 11<br/>
    > LOAD      : 20<br/>
    > STORE     : 21<br/>
    > ADD       : 10<br/>
    > SUBTRACT  : 31<br/>
    > DIVIDE    : 32<br/>
    > MULTIPLY  : 33<br/>
    > BRANCH    : 40<br/>
    > BRANCHNEG : 41<br/>
    > BRANCHZERO: 42<br/>
    > HALT      : 43<br/>

## Assumptions:
- All constants used in program are positive<br/>
- We can still use negative constansts by writing:<br/>
```
(0 - $constantvalue) in place of (-$constant)
```
